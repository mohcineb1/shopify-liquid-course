# Progress log

Append-only. One entry per completed pass, newest last. Never rewrite an old entry.

**Ground truth for "where am I" is `python3 scripts/next.py`**, which reads the actual
files. This log is the narrative that the file states cannot capture: judgement calls,
open flags, and anything the next session needs to know. If the two disagree, trust
`next.py` and record the discrepancy here.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD · <unit-id> · <pass>
- wrote: <paths>
- flagged: <[VERIFY] items, or none>
- decided: <judgement calls worth remembering, or none>
- next: <what scripts/next.py printed afterwards>

- wrote: whole repo — 83 units generated from `index/shopify-liquid-course-index.md`
- decided: generation unit is one chapter; solutions live in a mirror tree, never in `course/`
- next: gate — verify `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md`

- wrote: `course/part-03-theme-architecture/ch-18-blocks-the-three-kinds/lesson.md` (2,467 words)
- flagged: [VERIFY] whether editor attributes are auto-applied to a generated block wrapper
- decided: this chapter is the **reference implementation**. Match its depth, structure,
  tone and length. When the contract is ambiguous, copy chapter 18.

## 2026-08-13 · gate · deprecations
- wrote: `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md`
- flagged: none
- decided: replaced the obsolete 20 MB individual-file claim with Shopify's current per-file limits; added the missing template, section-group, block, naming, and aggregate-theme limits; retained `{% block %}` / `{% partial %}` as developer-preview-only material.
- next: ch-18 review
