### ch-18 — Blocks: The Three Kinds
**Taught:** section blocks defined in a section schema; theme blocks as files in `blocks/`; app blocks via `@app` and `{% render block %}`; `block.type` / `block.id` / `block.settings` / `block.shopify_attributes`; `max_blocks` and per-type `limit`; the filename-is-the-type contract; underscore-prefixed private blocks; `"tag": null`; the `@theme` wildcard; the four ceilings (25 / 50 / 300 / 8); the decision rule for choosing a kind.
**Introduced terms:** theme block, section block, app block, private block, static block, block picker, `@theme` wildcard.
**Assumed known from earlier:** section schema and `section.blocks` (ch-17), JSON templates and section groups (ch-15, ch-16), `{% case %}` and `{% for %}` (ch-07, ch-08), `image_url` / `image_tag` (referenced only — taught properly in ch-43).
**Deliberately deferred:** nesting mechanics, static blocks in depth, full block schema → ch-19. `content_for 'blocks'` / `content_for 'block'` → ch-20. Snippet-vs-block boundary → ch-21. Theme app extensions and app embeds → ch-56.
**Exercise:** refactor a duplicated section-block component into public/private theme blocks plus a static heading, across two sections, admitting app blocks.
